# Model-Free Residual Stress Approximation

This repository contains the Bachelor Thesis Project Report titled **"Model-Free Residual Stress Approximation"**, conducted at the **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur** under the supervision of **Prof. Biswanath Banerjee**.

The thesis focuses on developing a physically interpretable, model-free framework to approximate residual stresses in anisotropic materials using:
- **Fabric tensor** representation of internal material structure.
- **Manifold-based interpretation** of strain energy invariants.
- **Residual energy function** for stress-strain deviation quantification.
- **Optimization-based parameter identification** using MATLAB.
